# The "Scenario" Activity

## Scenario Proposal

Each participant proposes a scenario, following the included template.

## Scenario Response

Each participant takes about 30 minutes to write a response to each scenario. Responses may include any mix of questions, rambling thoughts and segues, mock schema definitions, and mock application specs.

If some aspect of the scenario is unspecified and critical to your response, feel free to imagine a specification and include it in your response.

## Response Discussion

Happens by phone.

## Response to Responses

Your post-mortem thoughts. Can be about your own response and/or another participant's response.
