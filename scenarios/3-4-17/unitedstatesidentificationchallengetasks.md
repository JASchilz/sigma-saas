# United States Identification Challenge Tasks

## Description

A student opens their console and is presented with some kind of invitation/reminder to study their US states. The student engages this notice and is brought to some kind of a study interface, presenting some mix of:

1. "Identify the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a map and asked to type the name of the state. Perhaps there is some kind of fuzzy matching for this input.
2. "Click the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a state name and a map of the US (with state lines drawn) and asked to click on the named state.

"opens their console" -> can you elaborate?

Would our schema as we're thinking of it be as specific as to describe the specific subsets of challenges or would it merely describe a "challenge" page with a "question" display element and an "answer" input element?

  To this point: I guess this goes to the nature of what our language is for... I mean, is the purpose to prototype a skeleton where the first view the dev looks at after running "build" is to see (literally) "Question" and a field for "Answer"?
  Put another way - are the specifics of how to implement the various state challenges part of the program-specific logic (the part we're trying to get to faster) or part of the infrastructure (the part we're trying to abstract away / avoid boilerplating / meta-program)?
