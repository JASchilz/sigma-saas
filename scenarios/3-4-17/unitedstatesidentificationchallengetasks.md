# United States Identification Challenge Tasks

## Description

A student opens their console and is presented with some kind of invitation/reminder to study their US states. The student engages this notice and is brought to some kind of a study interface, presenting some mix of:

1. "Identify the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a map of the united states with state lines drawn and one state colored and asked to type the name of the state. Perhaps there is some kind of fuzzy matching for this input.
2. "Click the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a state name and a map of the US (with state lines drawn) and asked to click on the named state.

The student's teacher can then review this student's activity. This review should include some measure of "did they do what I told them to do" (engage their US state study) and some measure of "did they do well at it"(perhaps number of questions missed).

The student's teacher MAY also have some kind of a summary of "did they do what I told them to do" and "did they do well at it" for the entire class.

Notably not mentioned here is challenge scheduling (shall the system today ask them to identify New Jersey, shall the system wait till a student is able to click on a state before asking them to produce the state name, etc.). Discuss if so inclined.
