# United States Identification Challenge Tasks

## Description

A student opens their console and is presented with some kind of invitation/reminder to study their US states. The student engages this notice and is brought to some kind of a study interface, presenting some mix of:

1. "Identify the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a map and asked to type the name of the state. Perhaps there is some kind of fuzzy matching for this input.
2. "Click the state" challenges, in which the student is presented with a state name and a map of the US (with state lines drawn) and asked to click on the named state.
